## Description

Apply the project's cyberpunk aesthetic to the TUI. Ghost is a character, not a tool—the interface should reflect the Shadowrun/Cyberpunk 2077 inspiration with themed colors, borders, and styling.

- [ ] Define color palette (neon accents, dark background)
- [ ] Style message bubbles/blocks for user vs ghost
- [ ] Style input area and borders
- [ ] Add status line with themed elements
- [ ] Ensure readability and accessibility
- [ ] tests
- [ ] documentation
